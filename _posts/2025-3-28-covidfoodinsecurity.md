How the COVID-19 Pandemic Impacted Food Insecurity in the U.S.

The COVID-19 pandemic changed so much about our daily lives—how we worked, learned, and even how we put food on the table. One of the biggest, but sometimes overlooked, impacts of the pandemic was the sharp rise in food insecurity, especially among families with children. While temporary policies helped ease the burden for many, the expiration of these programs has left communities struggling to meet the ongoing demand.

A Sudden Surge in Food Insecurity
Food insecurity—meaning a household’s limited or uncertain ability to obtain adequate food—was already a significant issue in the U.S. before the pandemic. But when COVID-19 hit, mass job losses, school closures, and disruptions in the supply chain made it even harder for millions of Americans to afford basic necessities.

According to the white paper, food insecurity rates soared, particularly among children. In New York alone, one in four families reported experiencing food insecurity in 2023, with rates rising for households earning less than $100,000 a year. This crisis wasn’t just about missing meals; it was about parents having to choose between paying rent and buying groceries, and kids going to school hungry.

Government Response: A Temporary Safety Net
The federal government responded by expanding food assistance programs, and these efforts made a real difference. Policies like increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT), and enhanced Child Tax Credits helped millions of families put food on the table.

For example, the expansion of the Child Tax Credit under the American Recovery Plan (ARP) reduced child poverty by 40%. Families that received this benefit were able to catch up on housing payments and reduce financial stress. Similarly, expanded SNAP benefits allowed households to redirect some of their food budgets to other essential expenses, like rent and utilities.

The End of Aid and Its Consequences
While these policies were effective, they were temporary. As the emergency measures expired, families that had come to rely on this support were left scrambling. Many food assistance programs, including SNAP, returned to pre-pandemic funding levels, which often weren’t enough to meet growing needs. In New York, for instance, only 14.7% of residents received SNAP benefits in 2023, and for many, those benefits were too low to make a meaningful impact.

With fewer resources available, food banks and local assistance programs have been overwhelmed. The demand for food assistance has skyrocketed, yet funding and donations haven’t kept pace. This has created an unsustainable strain on the emergency food system, leaving many families in a precarious position.

What Can Be Done?
The pandemic revealed both the strengths and weaknesses of our food assistance programs. While temporary expansions helped reduce hunger and stabilize families, the return to pre-pandemic policies has left many vulnerable again. So, what can be done to address food insecurity in the long term?

Expand Tax Credits: Permanent expansions to the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit could significantly reduce child poverty and improve food security. Studies have shown that families receiving these benefits experience better health and economic stability.

Increase SNAP Benefits: Raising the monthly SNAP benefit amount and expanding eligibility would allow more families to afford nutritious food. Additional programs like Double Up Food Bucks, which matches SNAP benefits for fruits and vegetables, could further enhance food security.

Universal Free School Meals: Ensuring that all children receive free breakfast and lunch at school would not only fight hunger but also improve academic performance and long-term health outcomes.

Moving Forward
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep inequalities in food access, but it also showed that policy interventions can work. While the emergency programs may have ended, the need has not. Addressing food insecurity requires long-term investment and policy changes that prioritize the well-being of families and children. By learning from the past and taking action now, we can build a stronger, more food-secure future for all.
