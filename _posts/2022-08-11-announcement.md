Today we found out we have been awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Build and Broaden 3.0 award to collaborate on a state food policy research project! The community-involved project is entitled, "An Ethnic Spring in the Food Desert? How State Policy Affects Food Environments and Business Entrepreneurship." The project examines the role sub-national policy and politics play in food environments across the United States, particularly in minority and immigrant communities.

For additional details on the project, please visit [About Project](/aboutproject.md) above.
