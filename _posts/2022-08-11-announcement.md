Today we found out we were awarded an NSF Build and Broaden award to collaborate on a community-involved food policy project! The project is entitled, "An Ethnic Spring in the Food Desert? How State Policy Affects Food Environments and Business Entrepreneurship." The project examines the role sub-national policy and politics play in food environments in the United States, particularly in minority and immigrant communities.
